Authors: Sindana D. Ilango, Claire E. Adam, Xinmei Huang, Cindy S. Leary, Erin O. Semmens, Annette L. Fitzpatrick, Paul K. Crane, Joel D. Kaufman, Anjum Hajat

This repository contains code used to analyze the associations between air pollution, cognitive level, and cognitive decline in the Ginkgo Biloba of Memory Study (GEMS). 

# Data Sources
Data for this study is from GEMS (Snitz et al.) and from an analysis on air pollution and dementia (Semmens et al.).

# Code
The following SAS programs are included in this repo: 
## 01_prep_data.sas
Code to prepare dataset for main and supplementary analyses. This program combines neuropsych testing administered to gems particiants to cohort data	and assigns study times and air pollution exposure. Tests from the full neuropsych exam is grouped into the following cog domains: (1) memory: cvlt_frl and ro_dr; (2) construction: ro_copy and blocks; (3) attention: dspan_f and ta_time; (4) language: bnt_spon and wg_anim; (5) executive function: tb_time and strink
## 02_prep_sens.sas
Code to prepare dataset for supplementary analyses 
## 03_analysis.sas
Code for analyses
